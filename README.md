# K-Cup Mesh Organizer

A simple 3D-printable K-Cup organizer.

## Usage

Pre-generated STLs are in [/out/stl](https://github.com/JoshMcCullough/kcup-mesh/blob/master/out/stl). Or you can clone this repo and generate organizers specific to your needs.

Then, place it in a drawer to keep your K-Cups from falling all over each other. :-)
